                  <p>Inventions create industries. And after years of domination by inventors and government agencies, these new industries turn to private companies. We've seen this happen with steam engines<sup><a href="#1" style= "text-decoration:underline; color:#0000FF">1</a></sup>, steel<sup><a href="#2" style= "text-decoration:underline; color:#0000FF">2</a></sup>, and telecommunications<sup><a href="#3" style= "text-decoration:underline; color:#0000FF">3</a></sup>. Now, we're seeing it happen with space.</p>
                  <p>For decades, the spaceflight industry was dominated exclusively by only a handful of powerful national governments with the resources to launch instruments and humans into space. NASA competed with the USSR in an intense space race in the 1960s, and the ESA was established later.</p>
                  <p>But towards the end of the 20th century, the US government deregulated space, giving private American companies access to orbit. The
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Space_Launch_Act_of_1984" style="text-decoration: underline; color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984</a>
                    and the
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Space_Launch_Competitiveness_Act_of_2015" style="text-decoration: underline; color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">SPACE Act of 2015</a>
                    removed restrictions on space exploration. NASA wanted partnerships with the private sector, so large space companies backed by the US government emerged, starting in satellite imagery with MAXAR Technologies (a combination of DigitalGlobe, SSL, Radiant Solutions, and Vricon) and in space launches with ULA (Lockheed Martin and Boeing).</p>
                  <p>But now, their dominance of spaceflight is being challenged by a new type of business: space startups, or “NewSpace.” By incorporating a flexible and entrepreneurial approach to space, these companies are dramatically altering the landscape of space exploration, introducing new technologies, and innovating across the industry.</p>

                    <strong>The Differences Between OldSpace Companies and NewSpace Startups, and Why High-Tech NewSpace Startups Win</strong>
                  </h3>
                  <p>Capitalism, free markets, and entrepreneurship create competition and drive innovation.</p>
                  <p>Newer, smaller startups with a tighter budget are forced to move faster, innovating and using advanced technologies while developing new inventions along the way. They take risks, using newer emerging technologies like 3D-printed rockets (Relativity Space) and aerospike engines (Firefly Alpha) to beat competitors. This type of intense competition is not seen in OldSpace, where big companies, like ULA, have guaranteed cashflow from government contracts and don't feel the need to innovate.</p>
                  <p>Newer space companies use innovative technologies to develop advanced launch vehicles that make NASA rockets look vintage.</p>
                  <br>

                  <p>The modern space startups of this decade have smaller and faster teams of younger employees. The environments at these startups are completely different — they resemble the results-driven workplaces of Google and Meta rather than the science-focused environments at NASA. They deploy new technologies initially developed in the information technology industry, like complex sensors, data analysis methods, and AI. In larger space contractor companies, launch solutions are custom-built and the customer manages every detail. This takes time and isn't viable for rapid, regular daily launches. Instead, NewSpace startups build products. They build advanced rockets first, then attract customers. This enables them to develop and “ship” products faster. This pattern was first seen in Silicon Valley, where software startups like Cloudflare beat established companies like Network Solutions.</p>
                  <p>Here's an interesting statistic: In 2023, while ULA completed 3 space launches, SpaceX completed 98 — SpaceX launches ULA's entire yearly launch volume almost every week. NASA and large space companies consistently underperform expectations while agile startups like SpaceX and Blue Origin move fast and make progress behind their eccentric tech entrepreneur CEOs.</p>

                    <strong>The Benefits of Free Market Capitalism in Space</strong>
                  </h3>
                  <p>Free market capitalism creates competition, which is a benefit in any industry because it leads to technological innovation and prosperity. In space, technology matters. The best way to build that technology is by allowing companies to compete with each other. As space startups develop innovative launch and rocket technologies to compete with each other, the cost of accessing space decreases.</p>
                  <p>This opens up a whole new world for humanity — literally. With inexpensive space launches, scientists and pioneers can further develop in space. There are now entire companies devoted solely to building high-tech space stations (Gravitics) for humans to live in. The cost of space tourism will go down and space will be easily accessible for more people.</p>
                  <p>There are so many possibilities to be explored in space. Asteroid mining will go mainstream. The moon will be a vacation destination for people all over the world. Inhabitable ground bases on Mars will allow scientists to further study the planet.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3 class="sectionheader">
                    <strong>What's Next For The Space Industry?</strong>
                  </h3>
                  <p>The goal of a company is to make money. To do that, it must enter a market that exists. This limits their ability to explore in space beyond Earth or the moon. NASA and other government agencies will always be the first to explore any particularly new part of space, and they always have been — they are the ones that explore new planets, collect asteroid samples, and observe stars. They are taking the risks for humanity, and we must respect that.</p>
                  <p>But we should also acknowledge that the inevitable replacement of old space companies by NewSpace is not necessarily harmful. NewSpace startups innovate, moving rapidly to build new rockets and incorporate emerging technologies into launch vehicles. They are poised to become industry leaders. They are the ones helping to lower the barrier of entry to space. They are the ones who truly advance humanity as a civilization. They are the ones enabling us to one day live our multi-planetary futures.</p>
                  <p>Because of modern space startups, the sky is no longer the limit.</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li id="1">Thomas Newcomen and James Watt developed/improved the steam engine. Governments (British government) regulated and expanded steam engine technologies, especially in the railway industry. Then, private companies like Boulton & Watt and George Stephenson and Company drove innovation forward by manufacturing steam engines and industrializing.</li>
                    <li id="2">Henry Bessemer and Sir William Siemens developed processes for making steel. Governments invested heavily in the steel industry and steel production, mostly for military needs. US Steel and TISCO, private steel companies, were established in 1901 and 1907, respectively.</li>
                    <li id="3">Alexander Graham Bell invented the first practical telephone, and Guglielmo Marconi pioneered long-distance radio transmission. Governments heavily invested in telecommunications (and radar) for military communications during the World Wars. AT&T, Nokia, Ericsson, and Motorola were private companies that later expanded and commercialized telecommunications.</li>
